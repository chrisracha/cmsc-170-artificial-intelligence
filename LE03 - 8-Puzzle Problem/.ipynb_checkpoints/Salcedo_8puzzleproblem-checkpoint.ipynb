    "##### 1. What is the problemt that needs a solution?\n",
    "\n",
    "The 8-puzzle problem is a sliding puzzle that consists of 8-numbered tiles, labeled 1-8, and an empty space in a 3x3 grid. The challenge is rearranging the tiles through that empty space to achieve a specific goal state.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 2. What is the initial state?\n",
    "\n",
    "The initial state is any valid state/configuration of the problem, serving as the starting point to where the problem-solving begins.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 3. What is the goal state?\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal state is the desired state/configuration that is to be achieved. The most common goal state is the numerically arranged state [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,0]].\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 4. What are the valid actions?\n",
    "The valid actions consist of four moves, representing the moves of the tiles into the empty space.\n",
    "\n",
    "* UP: Move the tile below the empty space upward.\n",
    "* DOWN: Move the tile above the empty space doenward\n",
    "* LEFT: Move the tile on the right of the empty space to the left\n",
    "* RIGHT: Move the tile on the left of the empty space to the right\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, the validity of a move or an action relies on the current condition of the empty space. If the empty space is located in a side or corner of the grid then there will not be enough tiles arround it to fullfill the allowability of the four listed moves.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 5. Whatis/are the functions that validate whether a state is valid?\n",
    "\n",
    "State validation check include constraints where,\n",
    "1. The board should only contain exactly 8 numbered tiles and one empty space\n",
    "2. All tiles are within the 3x3 boundaries\n",
    "3. No duplicate numbers exist, and\n",
    "4. The state is reachable from the initial state"
